# Proposal: Promote abyss-w as go-storage Committer

## Background

[abyss-w] is an active contributor of go-storage and related services, and was nominated as go-storage reviewer in [#39](https://github.com/beyondstorage/community/pull/39). Since then, she has continued to contribute to the project and has become a valuable contributor to the project.

She has drafted and implemented following go-storage proposals:

- [GSP-751: Write Empty File Behavior](https://github.com/beyondstorage/go-storage/pull/751)
- [GSP-826: Add Multipart HTTP Signer Support](https://github.com/beyondstorage/go-storage/pull/826)

Also, she has implemented following go-service-*:

- [azfile](https://github.com/beyondstorage/go-service-azfile)
- [bos](https://github.com/beyondstorage/go-service-bos)
- [obs](https://github.com/beyondstorage/go-service-obs)
